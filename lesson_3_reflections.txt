When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when collaborating, using multiple dev platforms, or in case you need another offsite backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to avoid overwriting your own changes you may not have pushed
