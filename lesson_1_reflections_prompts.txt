How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    far easier than manually doing it

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    of course

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Both have good use cases depending on the source of errors or failure. Auto save 
    will be best in unstable environments where loss due to falure is a major concern,
    but manual errors are less difficult to find. Manual commits will be better when 
    the time it takes to compair each individual change is the main concern.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The priority of project versions as a collection of files vs single file projects.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    It allows you to see when and by whom the changes have been made and what changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It keeps it easy to revert to past versions or fix the new one.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A simple Udacity FED Nanodegree project.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	less stress from tracking inevitable bugs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log gives you an overview of past commits. Git diff allows you to see the individual changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	With all previous versions recorded you can always reverse or recover from your mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I'm not sure that this changes my view of git but, it reminded me I like vim.
